 abstractNote={The nuclear life-cycle is intimately linked to that of its facilities. As a nuclear licensee, CEA (Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) is responsible for the cleanup and dismantling of its end-of-life facilities, as well as for managing the resulting waste. These operations must be performed in compliance with the safety rules, while minimizing their environmental impact, with a view to sustainable development and meeting cost and deadline constraints. The dismantling of the civil nuclear facilities on the Cadarache, Grenoble, Saclay, Fontenay-aux-Roses sites, the Phenix reactor and the Marcoule pilot facility, and of the former UP1 military plant in Marcoule, is being handled through 24 DEN projects. These facilities are extremely diverse: particle accelerators, research laboratories, effluent and waste treatment plants, reactors of various types. They all have different histories and types of operation. This means that a broad range of technologies needs to be utilized. CEA has defined 3 projects that are priorities, owing to their strategic nature: -) the dismantling of all the nuclear facilities on the CEA Grenoble site (Passage project); -) the dismantling of the nuclear facilities on the CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses site, as part of the Aladin project. -) the dismantling of the former UP1 spent fuel reprocessing plant in Marcoule. The Passage Project is now completed and dismantling operations will have generated about 25,000 m3 of radioactive waste, including about 22,000 m3 of very low level waste, 3,000 m3 of low and intermediate level waste, and 20 m3 of high level waste. The budget for the Passage project, amounting to 267 million euros, was kept under control and spent over a 15 year period. (A.C.)},
