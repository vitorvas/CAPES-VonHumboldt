 title={Cleanup and dismantling of nuclear facilities},
 ISSN={0298-6248},
 abstractNote={The nuclear life-cycle is intimately linked to that of its facilities. As a nuclear licensee, CEA (Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) is responsible for the cleanup and dismantling of its end-of-life facilities, as well as for managing the resulting waste. These operations must be performed in compliance with the safety rules, while minimizing their environmental impact, with a view to sustainable development and meeting cost and deadline constraints. The dismantling of the civil nuclear facilities on the Cadarache, Grenoble, Saclay, Fontenay-aux-Roses sites, the Phenix reactor and the Marcoule pilot facility, and of the former UP1 military plant in Marcoule, is being handled through 24 DEN projects. These facilities are extremely diverse: particle accelerators, research laboratories, effluent and waste treatment plants, reactors of various types. They all have different histories and types of operation. This means that a broad range of technologies needs to be utilized. CEA has defined 3 projects that are priorities, owing to their strategic nature: -) the dismantling of all the nuclear facilities on the CEA Grenoble site (Passage project); -) the dismantling of the nuclear facilities on the CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses site, as part of the Aladin project. -) the dismantling of the former UP1 spent fuel reprocessing plant in Marcoule. The Passage Project is now completed and dismantling operations will have generated about 25,000 m3 of radioactive waste, including about 22,000 m3 of very low level waste, 3,000 m3 of low and intermediate level waste, and 20 m3 of high level waste. The budget for the Passage project, amounting to 267 million euros, was kept under control and spent over a 15 year period. (A.C.)},

  title = {Activity Characterization Studies in FiR 1 TRIGA Research Reactor Decommissioning},
  abstract = {During normal operation of a nuclear reactor neutrons cause fission reactions in the uranium fuel producing energy. In addition, some of the neutrons from reactor core are also absorbed into the construction materials close to the core causing activating nuclear reactions in these materials. Radioactive characterization is the process of determining the radiological properties of reactor fuel and activated structural materials. In the early phase of a decommissioning project characterization is performed with non-destructive computational methods and by studying material samples collected from low-active outer parts of a reactor. FiR 1 is a TRIGA Mark II type research reactor operated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The reactor has been used for various research and education purposes and producing radioisotopes for both medical and industrial use for years 1962-2015. This thesis consists of the activity characterization work carried out in the FiR1 TRIGA research reactor decommissioning project during the years 2014-2019. Radionuclides in the spent nuclear fuel were studied with two separate burnup calculation models. The calculated nuclide inventories were also tested by applying them in a computational dose rate model. The results were compared with dose rates that had been measured earlier from individual fuel elements. Activated construction materials were studied by building a three dimensional neutron transport calculation model of the reactor structures to calculate the neutron fluxes during reactor operation. This data was combined with reactor operation history and material-specific activating impurity concentrations to model the production of different radionuclides in these materials. Conservative assumptions have been used especially regarding material compositions and operational history modelling simplifications to provide slightly overestimated activities. Measurements from active samples support the calculated results and indicate that the calculations have been conservative as intended. The results from activity characterization are used in a nuclear decommissioning project as input data for estimating the amount of radioactive waste, choosing optimal dismantling methods, planning the practical radiation safety during dismantling and estimating the long-term safety of final disposal of decommissioning waste. The thesis also briefly describes applying the results in these parts of the FiR 1 reactor decommissioning project.},

OpenMC uses continuous-energy cross sections and a constructive solid geometry representation, enabling high-fidelity modeling of nuclear reactors and other systems. Modern, portable input/output file formats are used in OpenMC: XML for input, and HDF5 for output. High performance parallel algorithms in OpenMC have demonstrated near-linear scaling to over 100,000 processors on modern supercomputers. Other topics discussed in this paper include plotting, CMFD acceleration, variance reduction, eigenvalue calculations, and software development processes.}
