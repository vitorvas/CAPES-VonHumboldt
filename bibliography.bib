 title={Cleanup and dismantling of nuclear facilities},
 ISSN={0298-6248},
 abstractNote={The nuclear life-cycle is intimately linked to that of its facilities. As a nuclear licensee, CEA (Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) is responsible for the cleanup and dismantling of its end-of-life facilities, as well as for managing the resulting waste. These operations must be performed in compliance with the safety rules, while minimizing their environmental impact, with a view to sustainable development and meeting cost and deadline constraints. The dismantling of the civil nuclear facilities on the Cadarache, Grenoble, Saclay, Fontenay-aux-Roses sites, the Phenix reactor and the Marcoule pilot facility, and of the former UP1 military plant in Marcoule, is being handled through 24 DEN projects. These facilities are extremely diverse: particle accelerators, research laboratories, effluent and waste treatment plants, reactors of various types. They all have different histories and types of operation. This means that a broad range of technologies needs to be utilized. CEA has defined 3 projects that are priorities, owing to their strategic nature: -) the dismantling of all the nuclear facilities on the CEA Grenoble site (Passage project); -) the dismantling of the nuclear facilities on the CEA Fontenay-aux-Roses site, as part of the Aladin project. -) the dismantling of the former UP1 spent fuel reprocessing plant in Marcoule. The Passage Project is now completed and dismantling operations will have generated about 25,000 m3 of radioactive waste, including about 22,000 m3 of very low level waste, 3,000 m3 of low and intermediate level waste, and 20 m3 of high level waste. The budget for the Passage project, amounting to 267 million euros, was kept under control and spent over a 15 year period. (A.C.)},

  title = {Activity Characterization Studies in FiR 1 TRIGA Research Reactor Decommissioning},
  abstract = {During normal operation of a nuclear reactor neutrons cause fission reactions in the uranium fuel producing energy. In addition, some of the neutrons from reactor core are also absorbed into the construction materials close to the core causing activating nuclear reactions in these materials. Radioactive characterization is the process of determining the radiological properties of reactor fuel and activated structural materials. In the early phase of a decommissioning project characterization is performed with non-destructive computational methods and by studying material samples collected from low-active outer parts of a reactor. FiR 1 is a TRIGA Mark II type research reactor operated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The reactor has been used for various research and education purposes and producing radioisotopes for both medical and industrial use for years 1962-2015. This thesis consists of the activity characterization work carried out in the FiR1 TRIGA research reactor decommissioning project during the years 2014-2019. Radionuclides in the spent nuclear fuel were studied with two separate burnup calculation models. The calculated nuclide inventories were also tested by applying them in a computational dose rate model. The results were compared with dose rates that had been measured earlier from individual fuel elements. Activated construction materials were studied by building a three dimensional neutron transport calculation model of the reactor structures to calculate the neutron fluxes during reactor operation. This data was combined with reactor operation history and material-specific activating impurity concentrations to model the production of different radionuclides in these materials. Conservative assumptions have been used especially regarding material compositions and operational history modelling simplifications to provide slightly overestimated activities. Measurements from active samples support the calculated results and indicate that the calculations have been conservative as intended. The results from activity characterization are used in a nuclear decommissioning project as input data for estimating the amount of radioactive waste, choosing optimal dismantling methods, planning the practical radiation safety during dismantling and estimating the long-term safety of final disposal of decommissioning waste. The thesis also briefly describes applying the results in these parts of the FiR 1 reactor decommissioning project.},

abstract = {FiR1 TRIGA research reactor was in operation from 1962 until 2015 and its dismantling was finalized in March 2024. All LILW nuclear waste generated from the dismantling project will be sent for final disposal to Loviisa NPP site, operated by power company Fortum. This requires careful waste activity characterization to fulfill Loviisa{\textquoteright}s waste acceptance criteria.Activity characterization of the FiR1 project is based on both calculations and measurements. Preliminary results were calculated with MCNP and ORIGEN-S codes. These have been further validated and refined during the project by sample measurements to form material-wise nuclide vectors. Finally, the packed waste is characterized with the ISOCS gamma spectrometric measurement setup.We describe the characterization methods, how they we utilized throughout the process and how the characterization results were reviewed and assessed. We also introduce specific challenges related to characterizing TRIGA research reactors and the connections with other aspects in decommissioning planning.},

abstract = {The present study proposes the potential implementation of eight different closed fuel cycle strategies for a NuScale-like reactor core using its own spent fuel as a reusable source of fissile material for energy production. For that, the spent fuel composition after three burnup cycles of approximately 12 MWd/kgU of NuScale-like initial core and five years of cooling in a spent fuel pool was theoretically reprocessed by GANEX or UREX+ methods. After reprocessing, these two new fuel compositions were spiked in a mixture of thorium (Th) or depleted uranium (DpU), and afterwards inserted into specific batch positions of the core. Therefore, the proposed NuScale-like core configurations contain fuel assemblies loaded with conventional uranium-based fuel and others loaded with reprocessed fuel, resulting in the following combinations: UO2 and GANEX spiked with Th, UO2 and GANEX spiked with DpU, UO2 and UREX+ spiked with Th, UO2 and UREX+ spiked with DpU. The main idea is to comprehend the advantages of adopting the closed nuclear fuel cycle for a NuScale-like reactor by comparing the reference case and the cases containing reprocessed fuel. The results exhibited that all instances in which the core was simulated with reprocessed fuel improved the feedback coefficient, maximum excess of reactivity varying the boron concentration in the coolant, and power peak factor (PPF). Furthermore, the closed nuclear fuel strategies also demonstrated savings of about 17.50% in terms of separating work units (SWU) due to plutonium and uranium recycling, and a potential burnup extension of approximately 43%. The Serpent code version 2.1.32 developed by VTT and ENDF/B-VII.0 nuclear data library has been used to perform the simulations.}

abstract = {Thorium-based fuels offer advantages such as superior fuel conversion and reduced plutonium buildup compared to traditional uranium oxide, arising as a relevant alternative for fueling the so-called small modular reactors (SMR). Most of the propositions for thorium-fueled reactors use thorium dioxide (ThO2) with the addition of some level of 233U or 235U. However, the full potential utilization of thorium resources might be aligned with the possible combination of ThO2 and a closed fuel strategy since the enrichment step is no longer required, simplifying the nuclear fuel cycle and increasing fuel utilization. In this way, the present study aims to adapt the conventional NuScale Power Modular and Scalable Reactor to a core containing ThO2 rods and reprocessed fuel rods obtained from the NuScale own spent fuel in two different fuel loading patterns: mono-lattice Th-RF core with only one type of fuel lattice and a multi-lattice Th-RF core with three different types of fuel lattices. The intended objective is to comprehend the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed cores by comparing their results with that of the conventional NuScale-like core loaded with uranium-based fuel. Compared to the conventional uranium-fueled core, the proposed designs showed improved feedback coefficients, better resistance to reactivity-initiated accidents, and longer fuel burnup cycles, increasing from 12 to over 25 MWd/kgHM. The multi-lattice core maintained a favorable power peak factor, while the mono-lattice core concentrated power generation at the center, which is less desirable. Simulations were performed using Serpent 2.1.32.}

abstract = {The Serpent 2 Monte Carlo code features a CAD-based geometry option for the modeling of complicated and irregular systems. The methodology is based on the STL data format, which is commonly used for computer graphics and 3D printing, and supported by a wide range of software tools. The methodology has been available for several years, but not described in complete detail. This paper presents the geometry routine with its advantages, limitations and known flaws. A brief overview on practical applications and a workflow example involving neutron and photon transport calculations for a spent nuclear fuel storage rack are provided for discussion. It is concluded that the CAD-based geometry type is a convenient option for various neutron and radiation transport problems, and does not suffer from significant deterioration in computational efficiency compared to conventional CSG models. It is also noted, however, that taking full advantage of the methodology requires some level of understanding on the software tools, the STL data format and the Serpent geometry routine to avoid the most common pitfalls.}
